# Public Scripts

A collection of utility scripts used by Meeting BaaS for various tasks. This repository contains reusable scripts for common operations across our projects.

## Contents

- **compare_openapi.sh**: Bash script to compare OpenAPI specifications between two Git versions
- **openapi_diff.py**: Python script to perform detailed comparison of OpenAPI JSON files

## Usage

Each script includes documentation on how to use it. Generally, you can run the bash scripts directly:

```bash
./script_name.sh [arguments]
```

For Python scripts:

```bash
python script_name.py [arguments]
```

## Requirements

- Bash scripts require a Unix-like environment
- Python scripts may require additional dependencies (specified in each script)

## Contributing

When adding new scripts, please include proper documentation and follow the established patterns.
